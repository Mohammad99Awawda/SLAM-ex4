We begin by loading KITTI‐style stereo intrinsics and ground‐truth poses,
then build a “TrackDB” that associates stereo keypoints over time,
perform several statistical analyses on those tracks (connectivity, inlier percentage, length histograms),
visualize one example long track as image patches, and finally compute and
plot reprojection errors using ground‐truth camera poses—all organized into
separate functions called from a single main()
